## \-\-\- Day 8: Haunted Wasteland ---

You're still riding a camel across Desert Island when you spot a sandstorm
quickly approaching. When you turn to warn the Elf, she disappears before your
eyes! To be fair, she had just finished warning you about _ghosts_ a few
minutes ago. One of the camel's pouches is labeled "maps" - sure enough, it's
full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At
least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a
list of left/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe
some kind of _network_ of labeled nodes.

It seems like you're meant to use the _left/right_ instructions to _navigate
the network_. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you
can escape the haunted wasteland!

After examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: `AAA` and `ZZZ`. You
feel like `AAA` is where you are now, and you have to follow the left/right
instructions until you reach `ZZZ`.

This format defines each _node_ of the network individually. For example:

```
RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)

```

Starting with `AAA`, you need to _look up the next element_ based on the next
left/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with `AAA` and go
_right_ ( `R`) by choosing the right element of `AAA`, `CCC`. Then, `L` means
to choose the _left_ element of `CCC`, `ZZZ`. By following the left/right
instructions, you reach `ZZZ` in `2` steps.

Of course, you might not find `ZZZ` right away. If you run out of left/right
instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: `RL`
really means `RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL...` and so on. For example, here is a situation
that takes `6` steps to reach `ZZZ`:

```
LLR

AAA = (BBB, BBB)
BBB = (AAA, ZZZ)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)

```

Starting at `AAA`, follow the left/right instructions. _How many steps are
required to reach `ZZZ`?_
